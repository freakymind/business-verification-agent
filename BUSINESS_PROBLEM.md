# Business Problem & Solution

## The Problem

### Manual Verification is Broken

Businesses, financial institutions, and compliance teams face critical challenges when verifying the legitimacy of companies and sole traders:

**Time & Resource Drain**

- Average cost: $75-150 per verification

**Inconsistent Results**
- Different analysts produce different conclusions
- No standardized verification methodology

- Subjective assessment without structured scoring

**Fraud & Risk Exposure**
